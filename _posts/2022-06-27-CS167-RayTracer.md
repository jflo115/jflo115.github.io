For my CSE 167 class (Computer Graphics), we were tasked to create a raytracer as a Final Project. Unfortunately for me, we are not allowed to share
the code as the class reuses the same project every year. Pretty lame if you ask me. Oh well, if you wanna see the code to the project just send me 
an email or something and I can get that over to you.
