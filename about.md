Name: Justin Flores
Age: 19
Day of Birth: Feb 4, wish me a happy Bday when the time comes.

I am a current student at UCSD, studying Mathematics-Computer Science. I am expecting to graduate in 2022. I didn't really know what to do with my life until perhaps my junior year of highschool, when I took AP Comp Sci. It was my first experience with coding and I fouond that it was a skill that came easy to me and one I really enjoyed doing. I aspire to either be a Software Developer, or a Video Game Designer.
